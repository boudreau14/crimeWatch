## Chicago Crime Watch

##	Purpose
Crime Watch is an app designed to give users the ability to view violent crimes in the greater Chicago area, as well as report crimes and add to our database. Working with the Chicago PD Crimes Reports Database (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2020/qzdf-xmn8), we were able to create a heat map with Google Maps API and show areas in which residents and tourists may want to avoid, or at least be aware of. 

## My Role
My main responsibilities included handling the database portions of the project (both from the public database, as well as user submitted information). I also worked with the Google Maps API to create a heat map representing all of the available crime data. 

## Technology Used	
Handlebars, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps API, Sequelize, & MySQL.
